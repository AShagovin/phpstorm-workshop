# phpstorm-workshop
Code for the [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm) workshop created by [Maarten Balliauw](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be), [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com).

## Getting the project
There are a couple of ways to get started with the PhpStorm workshop materials:

* Clone the project using GitHub

    ``git clone https://github.com/maartenba-demo/phpstorm-workshop.git``

* Create a new project using Composer. Note that you can also create a new project in PhpStorm and use the Composer project type and search for "jetbrains/phpstorm-workshop"

    ``php composer.phar create-project jetbrains/phpstorm-workshop -s dev``

* Download the ZIP

    ``wget https://github.com/maartenba-demo/phpstorm-workshop/archive/master.zip``

## Getting started
There are some things to know about the project:

* The project can be opened as-is in PhpStorm. No settings are included in the project yet, because these are configured when following exercises.
* All numbered folders contain exercises that you can work on. Simply open the numbered files one by one and follow the comments in the file. Most exercises are self-contained, others build on previous exercises.
* The PhpStorm Workshop.pptx is a slide deck which summarizes many of the items covered in exercises.
* The PhpStorm Reference Card.pdf is the PhpStorm keymap. The latest version can always be found on the [PhpStorm website](http://bit.ly/phpstorm-shortcuts).
